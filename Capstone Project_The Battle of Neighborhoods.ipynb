In this scenario, a lot of international delegates will attend the conference: many of them will be travelling to New York for the first time. As New York is such a huge city, it can be scary for a data scientist to visit alone for the first time. Many other data scientists from different countries, need to plan their travel to New York - flights are the easy part. The event will take place at Pier 94 in New York.\n\nAs this many of the target audience's first time visiting New York, they would like to be close to the venue. They would also want to know about the safety of the neigborhoods close to the venue, ratings of hotels close to the venue, restuarants where they can eat, as well as mingle with other delegates close to venue after each long day of data science lectures overload.\n\nHow do we get the best place to stay for the data scientists, but also offer alternatives in case they want something else?"

Our success will be measured by the manual reviews we receive from our delegates we are doing the travel planning for."
